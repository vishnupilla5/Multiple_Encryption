# Multiple-Encrypion
The main idea is to achieve multiple encryption using the above mentioned algorithms. It is the process of encrypting an already encrypted message one or more times, either using the same or different algorithm.
For the multiple encryption, we used the Caesar Cipher, AES Cipher, XOR Cipher, Blowfish Cipher algorithms.
For the super encryption (the outer encryption), we used the RC6 file encryption algorithm
ALGORITHMS USED
	Caesar Cipher
	XOR Cipher
	AES Cipher
	Blowfish Cipher
	RC6


This project enhanced the different encryption algorithm with multiple encryption process and varying encryption key. Here the random key generation concept is used. The algorithm is tested on plain text and found more secure than the single level encryption algorithms. However, the new enhancement method can encrypt text through four different algorithms. The method of multiple encryption has been clearly shown to be more secure than any single level encryption
